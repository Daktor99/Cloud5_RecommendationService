## Connection Info:
### AWS EC2
EC2 Instance Public Address: ec2-18-119-118-50.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com  

### AWS RDS (MySQL):
export DBHOST=database.czthk9zzx7f7.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com

#### Quick Note: This is hosted on my AWS Student account and I have to have a AWS student session running for my RDS instance to be running. Will try to migrate this out to a personal RDS instance to ease of use. Will also upload a SQL creation script to entire DB so that others can create their own RDS instance running the same way.
